I"Í<h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>

<p>This site is designed to provide a showcase for robots using ROS.</p>

<h2 id="who-can-contribute">Who can contribute?</h2>

<p>Anyone can contribute to the site. However, it is expected that the majority of contributors will be the robot manufacturers or ROS integration maintainers.</p>

<h2 id="what-content-should-be-on-the-site">What content should be on the site?</h2>

<p>This site is designed to be a portal for discovery and comparison of robots with publicly documented ROS interfaces.</p>

<p>Developer documentation should remain on the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org">ROS wiki</a>, usually â€˜http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/RobotNameâ€™.
Where <code class="highlighter-rouge">RobotName</code> is substituted for your robotâ€™s name.</p>

<p>Pages on this site should not be the primary reference for a robot.
It should have its own website with the majority of its marketing and promotional content.</p>

<h2 id="featured-spotlight">Featured Spotlight</h2>

<p>Robots may be promoted to the spotlight on the home page.
To inquire about being promoted please contact business@osrfoundation.org .</p>

<h2 id="how-to-contribute">How to contribute</h2>

<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/robots.ros.org">open a pull request on github</a> to add a robot or make an update to the site.</p>

<p>Documentation on how the site is setup can be found below.</p>

<h2 id="guidelines-for-contributions">Guidelines for contributions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure to follow the tagging conventions.</li>
  <li>Do not spam the site with small variants of robot names. Only have one entry per major version; a model upgrade should not generate a new page.</li>
  <li>Keep the look and feel of the overall site, but feel free to customize within the framework.</li>
  <li>External javascript dependencies are generally discouraged but can be considered.</li>
  <li>When you commit changes please do not include the url change in <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">main.css</code> is generated by gulp when you run the site. For the site to be rendered on github pages the css has to be committed into the repo. So any time you change a style file, please also commit the generated css.</li>
</ul>
