<p>The omnidirectional <strong>MPO-700</strong> is the ideal base for high-end service robots. Its four <a href="http://www.neobotix-robots.com/components.html#c225">Omni-Drive-Modules</a> enable it to move extremely smoothly into any direction. This robot is even capable of rotating freely while driving to its destination.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fully omnidirectional manoeuvrability</li>
  <li>Very steady movements</li>
  <li>High stability and payload</li>
  <li>Compact, easily integrated drive units</li>
</ul>

<p>This makes the <strong>MPO-700</strong> a high performance alternative for applications that require omnidirectional movements without the limitations of traditional kinematics.</p>
