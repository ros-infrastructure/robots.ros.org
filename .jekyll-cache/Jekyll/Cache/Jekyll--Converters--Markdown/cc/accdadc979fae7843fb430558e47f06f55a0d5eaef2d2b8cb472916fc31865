<p>The mobile robot <strong>MPO-500</strong> features four Mecanum wheels which provide an extraordinary manoeuvrability. Each Mecanum wheel has several independent rollers mounted along its circumference. The axles of the rollers are rotated at 45Â° to the wheelâ€™s main axle. This design enables the robot to instantly move into any direction: the Mecanum wheels make it truly omnidirectional.
These extraordinary features have made Mecanum wheels a very popular solution especially in robotics research.</p>
