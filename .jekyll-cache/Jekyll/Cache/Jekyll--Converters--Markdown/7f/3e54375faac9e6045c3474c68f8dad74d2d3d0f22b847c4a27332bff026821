<p>The anthropomorphic SCHUNK 5-finger hand grips nearly as perfectly as the human hand. Due to the moving parts with a total of nine drives, various gripping operations can be executed with high sensitivity. Elastic gripping surfaces ensure a reliable grip on objects. The electronics are completely integrated in the wrist.</p>

<h3 id="field-of-application">Field of application</h3>
<p>In addition to new dimensions in gripping and manipulation tasks, SCHUNK is defining the possibility of human / robot communication by gestures with the 5-finger hand.</p>

<h3 id="advantages--your-benefits">Advantages â€“ Your benefits</h3>

<p>The ready for series production version of the anthropomorphic SCHUNK 5-finger hand grips nearly as perfectly as the human hand. Due to the moving parts with a total of nine drives, various gripping operations can be executed with high sensitivity. Elastic gripping surfaces ensure a reliable grip on objects. The electronics are completely integrated in the wrist.</p>

<p>The anthropomorphic SCHUNK 5-Finger-Hand is used together with the lightweight robotic arm LWA 4P to simulate human motions. The size, weight, and flexibility of the 5-Finger-Hand are very similar to a real human hand and can be used for dexterous manipulation and gestures. A new developed ROS driver for the hand controls all nine active joints and is used together with the ROS motion driver of the 6-DOF arm. An intuitive teach-in interface with the ability to add, edit and save new key pose makes it easy to create new trajectories for a desired task. The trajectories between these key points are interpolated automatically. The hand and arm trajectories are synchronized and create smooth combined motions as shown in the video.</p>
