I"ç<p>AutoRally is a high-performance testbed for robotics research. The robot, developed
at Georgia Tech, is integrated with ROS and designed as a self contained system that requires no external sensing or
computing. The robot is a robust, cost-effective, and safe platform that opens the space of aggressive autonomous
off-road driving to researchers and hobbyists. The core software and simulation environment for the platform are publicly
available along with tutorials. Build instructions for the chassis and compute box, complete parts list, CAD models, and
operating procedures are released in a separate GitHub repository. If you are interested in the platform, fork and test
the simulation, check out the documentation, and let us know if you have any questions.</p>
