<p>SensorHand Speed is a hand prosthetics product developed by Otto Bock.
The device essentially consists of a force and velocity controlled gripper that is controlled by integrated electronics.
In normal operation mode, electrodes that are attached to the userâ€™s arm are connected to the handâ€™s interface and provide analog signals that allow gripping operations.
The hand can also be switched to communications mode which allows accessing the device via an RS-232 interface (19200-8-N-1).
It is also possible to set the device to a mode in which internal data (measured forces, voltages and currents) is sent over the serial interface every 12 ms.</p>
