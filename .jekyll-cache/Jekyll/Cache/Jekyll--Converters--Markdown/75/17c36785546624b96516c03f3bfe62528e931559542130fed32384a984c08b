<p>TUlip is a humanoid robot developed in the <a href="http://www.tue.nl/en/university/departments/mechanical-engineering/research/research-groups/dynamics-and-control/">Dynamics and Control group</a> of the <a href="http://www.tue.nl/en/university/departments/mechanical-engineering/">department of Mechanical Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.tue.nl/en/">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>.</p>

<p>TUlip has been designed and realized in 2009 by the Eindhoven University of Technology in cooperation with the Delft University of Technology, the University of Twente en Philips.
The robot is 125 centimeters tall, weighs approximately 25 kilograms, and has two legs with each six degrees of freedom.
An inertial measurement unit provides orientation information for the robot and a head with a stereovision camera system mounted on a neck mechanism gives TUlip 3D vision.
Contact forces with the ground are measured through pressure sensors under its feet.</p>

<p>Research in the humanoid robotics group focuses on dynamics and balance of human-like walking, computer vision, localization and path planning to ensure autonomous operation of walking robots in natural environments, such as homes, offices and hospitals.</p>
