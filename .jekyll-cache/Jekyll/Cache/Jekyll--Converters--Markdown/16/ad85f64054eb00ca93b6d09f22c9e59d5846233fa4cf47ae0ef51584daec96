I"Ò<p>WheeledRobin is a two wheeled robot that balances on his wheels and is able to
receive commands via the serial interface from a host computer. The robot was
developed at the Institute for Robotics at Johannes Kepler University Linz. The
commands are related to the SCI for the iRobot Roomba but are not fully
compatible. The ROS interface of WheeledRobin is similar to the interface of
TurtleBot. This allows to use many of the demos available for TurtleBot.</p>
