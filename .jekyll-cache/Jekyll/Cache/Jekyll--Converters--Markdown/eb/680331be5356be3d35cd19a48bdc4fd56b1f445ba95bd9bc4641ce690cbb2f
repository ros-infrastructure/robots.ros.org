<h2 id="what-is-revel">What is Revel?</h2>
<p>Revel is a medium sized, lightweight, power efficient 6 degree of freedom robotic manipulator from Svenzva Robotics. But Revel is alsoâ€¦</p>

<p>The Revel Robotic Armâ€™s abilities make it uniquely poised as an inexpensive platform for education. Whether youâ€™re teaching robotic principles, robotics in manufacturing, control theory or artificial intelligence- Revel is a perfect test bed.</p>

<h3 id="a-way-to-automate">A way to automate</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/img/robots/revel/revel_automation.jpg" alt="Revel automates material handling" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Using ROS and Svenzva Roboticsâ€™ software, Revel can be taught a new behavior quickly and repeatably. This makes Revel an inexpensive option to test or add automation to your companyâ€™s light manufacturing workflow.</p>

<p>Revelâ€™s motors provide you with all the data you could need: position, velocity, acceleration, torque through current sensing, just to name a few.
Revel has high level control through ROS drivers, the MoveIt! and  ros_control packages, and cartesian commanded movement, allowing you to get up and running on the platform quickly.</p>

<p>However, the motors also have low level access, should you need it. So you can implement your own control loop algorithm at any time.</p>
