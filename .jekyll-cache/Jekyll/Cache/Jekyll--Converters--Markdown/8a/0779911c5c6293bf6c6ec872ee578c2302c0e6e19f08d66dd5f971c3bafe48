<p>The Nav2 is a modular robotics platform created by Crosswing Inc, consisting of an omniwheel holonomic mobile base and interchangeable upper components.
The Nav2â€™s base configuration is that of a telepresence robot, the VirtualMe.
To operate the mobile base, you must connect your control computer to the Nav2â€™s control board, located in the lower compartment.
The board can be networked with using a variety of configurations such as static IP, or DHCP with zeroconf DNS (e.g. avahi).
Once connected, you can start the appropriate launch file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">nav2_platform</code> stack to begin controlling the base.</p>
