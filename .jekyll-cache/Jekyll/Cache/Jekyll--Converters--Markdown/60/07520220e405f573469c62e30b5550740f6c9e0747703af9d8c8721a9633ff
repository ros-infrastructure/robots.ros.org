<p>Pepper is a commercially available humanoid robot built by Aldebaran and Softbank Robotics.
Since the robot uses Aldebaran‚Äôs NaoQI framework, we can use naoqi driver ROS driver that is common for Nao, Pepper, and Romeo.
It wraps the needed parts of NaoQI API and makes it available in ROS.</p>

<p>A list of tutorials inclusive install and bring-up instructions can be found <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/pepper/Tutorials">here</a>.
Since Pepper and Nao both use the same NaoQI framework, see <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/nao/Tutorials">Nao‚Äôs tutorials</a> for further references.</p>
