I"Þ<p>Romeo is a humanoid robot built by <a href="https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en">Aldebaran</a>. 
The ROS Romeo description was originally developed by LAAS <a href="https://github.com/laas/romeo">laas/romeo stack</a>. 
Since the robot uses Aldebaranâ€™s NaoQI framework, we can use <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/naoqi_driver">naoqi_driver</a>
ROS driver that is common for Nao, Pepper, and Romeo. 
It wraps the needed parts of NaoQI API and makes it available in ROS.</p>
