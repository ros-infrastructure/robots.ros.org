<p>Aubo robotics I-Series are high-quality and low-cost industrial robots with a fully modulized design.
The robotics can be configured 4 to 7 degrees of freedom to meet specific requirements.
I-series robots adopt open source software architecture, which is convenient for users and developers to inregrate existing software and algorithms.
Compared with the industral robots with similar features and payloads, I-series robots are compact, light weight, high accuray, and easy to instal and program.</p>
