REEM-C is the latest commercial humanoid robot of PAL Robotics. REEM-C is an adult size humanoid (165 cm), and it has 44 degrees of freedom, two i7 computers, force/torque and range finders on each feet, stereo camera, 4 microphones, and other devices that make REEM-C one of the best equipped research platforms today. Optionally, a depth camera can also be attached to the head. It also has already developed software for walking, grasping, navigation and human-robot interaction. REEM-C runs on ROS internally, and uses state-of-the-art [ros_control](http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control) and OROCOS.

More information can be found in the [PAL Robotics](http://pal-robotics.com) website.

## Installation

A feature-rich Gazebo simulation setup for REEM-C is freely available on PAL Robotics' github page.

Instructions on how to install can be found in the [how to launch REEM-C in gazebo tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/REEM-C/Tutorials).
