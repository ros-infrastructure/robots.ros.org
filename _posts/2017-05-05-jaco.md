The JACO Robot Arm is modular and efficient, with a payload-to-weight ratio that is ideal for day to day activities, perfect for advanced manipulation research.
The arm is powered by a 24V battery or standard electrical plug, so users can enjoy the system on day one.
The JACO Robot Arm can safely handle everyday objects by utilizing the three under-actuated fingers.
With 6 degrees of freedom, JACO allows for flexible, safe, and effective interaction in almost any environment.
