**Mecanumrover Ver.3.0** is a four-wheel drive mobile platform with mecanum wheels developed by [[Vstone Co., Ltd.](https://www.vstone.co.jp/english/index.html)] for researchers. 
The omnidirectional base provides precision positioning in constrained environments.

Mecanumrover Ver.3.0 inherits most of the features from its [predecessor](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/Mecanumrover/MecanumroverVer2.1), such as:
- a large payload of 40 kg
- an aluminum housing for easy sensor-mounting and other customization
- Arduino IDE support for effortless software development
- ROS compatible

In addition, it is powered by brushless direct-drive in-wheel motors, which allows noise reduction for up to 20db.
