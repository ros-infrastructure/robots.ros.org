## Features

**Work operation with obstacle avoidance**
Redundant 7-axis, orthogonal-axis design allows for close-to-human operation depending on the program.
You can set the action to avoid obstacles.

**Selectable Mode**
By the ROBOTIS servo, the position, speed, and torque (current) control can be selected in the mode.

**ROS Adaptive**
Standard ROS Support.
Combined with a variety of ROS packages, the range of research is broadened.
