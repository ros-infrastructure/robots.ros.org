Jackal is a small, fast, entry-level field robotics research platform. It has an onboard computer, GPS and IMU fully integrated with ROS for out-of-the-box autonomous capability. As with all Clearpath robots, Jackal is plug-and-play compatible with a huge list of robot accessories to quickly expand your research and development.

Jackal was unveiled at [IROS 2014](http://www.iros2014.org/), and is shipping as of late 2014.

Jackal includes an integrated PC running Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo. To install the software on your control computer, first ensure that you are using Ubuntu 14.0.4 LTS, and have [ROS Indigo](indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) installed.
