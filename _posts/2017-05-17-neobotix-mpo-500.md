## Neobotix Mobile Platform MPO-500

The mobile robot **MPO-500** features four Mecanum wheels which provide an extraordinary manoeuvrability. Each Mecanum wheel has several independent rollers mounted along its circumference. The axles of the rollers are rotated at 45Â° to the wheel's main axle. This design enables the robot to instantly move into any direction: the Mecanum wheels make it truly omnidirectional.
These extraordinary features have made Mecanum wheels a very popular solution especially in robotics research.
