## Neobotix MPO-500
The mobile robot MPO-500 features four Mecanum wheels which provide an extraordinary manoeuvrability. Each Mecanum wheel has several independent rollers mounted along its circumference. The axles of the rollers are rotated at 45Â° to the wheel's main axle. This design enables the robot to instantly move into any direction: the Mecanum wheels make it truly omnidirectional.
These extraordinary features have made Mecanum wheels a very popular solution especially in robotics research.

## Mobile Manipulator MMO-500
The mobile manipulator MMO-500 combines the omnidirectional robot MPO-500 with most of the available light weight arms. Due to its big footprint and high payload, the MMO-500 is also capable of carrying the big Universal Robots arm UR10 which can handle loads up to 10 kg.
