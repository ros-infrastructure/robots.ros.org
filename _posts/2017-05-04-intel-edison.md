# Intel Edison

The Intel® Edison is an ultra small computing platform that will allow you to jump into ROS with a stamp size computer.

Each Edison is provides the same robust strength of your go-to single board computer.
Powered by the Intel® Atom™ SoC dual-core CPU and including an integrated WiFi, Bluetooth LE, and a 70-pin connector to attach a veritable slew of shield-like “Blocks” which can be stacked on top of each other.
The Intel® Edison packs a robust set of features into its small size, delivering great performance, durability, and a broad spectrum of I/O and software support.
Those versatile features help meet the needs of a makers, inventors, and beginners.
This is a module with a high speed processor and WiFi and Bluetooth Radios on board.
Its low power and small footprint make it ideal for projects that need a lot of processing power, but don’t have the ability to be near a larger power source or have a large footprint.

The Intel® Edison Mini Breakout is designed to expose the native 1.8 V I/O of the Intel® Edison module.
The board consists of power supply, battery recharger, USB OTG power switch, UART to USB bridge, USB OTG port, and I/O header
