The mechArm27 belongs to the "mechArm" series of six-axis articulated robotic arms from Elephant
Robot. It uses a Raspberry Pi microprocessor and supports ROS simulation software. It is an industrial-like launched by Elephant Robot for maker innovation and robot industry-university-research
services.
The body weight of mechArm270 -M5 is 1kg, the payload is 250g, and the working radius is 270mm. The design is compact and portable. It is small but powerful, easy to operate, and can work with people safely. As the first small six-axis robotic arm of Elephant Robot, it has three advantages: ease of use, safety and economy, and is a cost-effective choice.
