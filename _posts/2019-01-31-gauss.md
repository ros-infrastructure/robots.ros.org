# Gauss6

Gauss6 is a perfect 6-axis robotics arm platform specifically designed for the ROS community and robotics learners. 

Gauss6 is typical study tool helping learners know the structure of a manipulation and native ROS programming. You can learn the standard structure, kinematics and robot control of a 6-axis manipulator from Gauss6. It has already sourced most ROS codes including path planning for a manipulator. Moreover, you can build up creative applications you like on it.

More details about Gauss6 can be found at [github repo](https://github.com/TonyRobotics/gauss) and [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/Gauss)

## Features

**Open**. Open software and 3D printable structure. 

**Affordable**. The price of Gauss6 can be accept by most family and school education and training. 

**EcoSystem**. Gauss6 will link users and innovators to form an ecosystem to share their ideas, examples, experiences, source codes, knowledge,know-how, creativity and, of course, fun.

**Easy to use**. Gauss6 comes with Tony Robot Studio to manage the comprehensive control and RoboWare Studio for easy ROS programming.
