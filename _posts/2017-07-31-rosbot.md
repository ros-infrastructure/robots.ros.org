ROSbot, along with an in-depth [ROS tutorial](https://husarion.com/core2/tutorials/ros-tutorials/1-ros-introduction/) that Husarion provides is an easy way to get familiar with this amazing software that powers modern robots. 

ROSbot is based on [Husarion CORE2-ROS controller](https://www.crowdsupply.com/husarion/core2). The CORE2-ROS is a new controller, dedicated for robotics. [Read more here](https://www.crowdsupply.com/husarion/core2).

The design of ROSbot is described on [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/21885-rosbot-autonomous-robot-platform) and [Instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/id/ROSbot-Autonomous-Robot-With-LiDAR/)
