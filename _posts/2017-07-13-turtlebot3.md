## TurtleBot 3

TurtleBot3 is a new generation mobile robot that is modular, compact and customizable. Let’s explore ROS and create exciting applications for education, research and product development.

The goal of TurtleBot3 is to drastically reduce the size and lower the price of the platform without sacrificing capability, functionality, and quality. Optional parts such as chassis, computers and sensors are available, and TurtleBot3 can be customized in various ways. TurtleBot3 is willing to be in the center of the maker movement by applying the latest technical advances of the SBC(Single Board Computer), the Depth sensor and 3D printing technology.

TurtleBot3 is a collaboration project among Open Robotics, ROBOTIS, and more partners like Intel, Onshape, OROCA. The Open Robotics is in charge of software and community activities, while ROBOTIS is in charge of manufacturing and global distribution. We need more partners who can provide technology, educational service or distribution in each country.

Documentation of the TurtleBot3 can be found on [TurtleBot3 wiki](http://turtlebot3.robotis.com).
