**Versatility and resistance**
SUMMIT-XL is a highly versatile Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) capable of carrying loads of up to 65 Kg.

The mobile robot can navigate autonomously or be teleoperated by means of a Pan-Tilt-Zoom camera that transmits video in real time.

The platform allows two types of configurations: with mecanum wheels or with rubber wheels. The former are recommended for indoor places while the latter are appropriate for outdoor environments. This makes the robot an agile and highly mobile vehicle.

The common sensor options include a Hokuyo laser scanner and a range of RTK-DGPS kits. Likewise, it has internal and external connectivity to easily connect all kinds of components.
SUMMIT-XL uses the ROS open architecture.

## Characteristics  

* Dimensions: 722 x 613 x 416 mm
* Weight: 65 Kg
* Load capacity: 65 Kg
* Speed: 3 m/s
* Accessories:
    * Laser (e.g. Hokuyo, Sick family)
    * Inertial Measurement System nIMU
    * Camera PTZ
    * GPS
    * Camera range 3D (ORBBEC)

SUMMIT-XL has 4 motorwheels that can mount different sets of wheels to adapt to different environment requirements:
* Skid-Steering: 4 rubber wheels - thus allowing extremely high performance in rough outdoor terrain.
* Omnidirectional Drive: 4 mecanum wheels - to get extremely good manoeuvrability indoors.
