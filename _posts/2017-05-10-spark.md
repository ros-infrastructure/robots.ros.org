# NXROBO Spark

Spark is an affordable development platform for ROS applications, with mobility and vision system.
The laptop and robot can be charged at the same time to achieve long-term operation without user intervention.
Power outputs are provided so accessories like a camera, loading platform, robot arm, and lidar can be easily added.
