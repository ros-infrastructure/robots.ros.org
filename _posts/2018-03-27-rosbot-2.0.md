ROSbot is an autonomous, open source robot platform based on ROS. Reinforced with set of tutorials, manuals, simulation model and examples, it is a great choice for prototyping and learning how to program autonomous vehicles.

It integrates:

- CPU: Rockchip RK3288, Quad-core ARM Cortex-A17 32-bit processor, 1.8 GHz
- GPU: ARM Mali-T764 MP2
- RAM: 2GB LPDDR3
- IMU: MPU 9250 or BNO055 (accelerometer + gyro)
- Distance sensor: VL53L0X (time-of-flight) 
- 4-wheel mobile platform with DC motors
- Li-ion batteries: 3 x 3500 mAh (with protection circuits)
- Rear panel providing interfaces for additional modules
- Robust aluminum chassis
