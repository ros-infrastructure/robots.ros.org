# What is QTrobot?
QTrobot, is a commercial available toddler-like humanoid robot built by [LuxAI S.A.](http://www.luxai.com). It is a socially engaging and interactive robot with a wide areas of application. QTrobot is currently being used for emotional training of children with autism, post-stroke rehabilitation and elderly cognitive and physical rehabilitation.


## Develop engaging applications effortlessly
QTrobot is a powerful and developer-friendly humanoid robot for research on human-robot interaction and robotics. With exceptional processing capabilities, standard development environment and direct connections to the robot's *display, Lan/Wifi, Mouse and Keyboard*, QTrobot is a **stand-alone** social robot platform to save your time in R&D and teaching. (**No need for cross compilation!**)

## Graphical Interface for even easier programming
Using its graphical interface, you can easily script new applications for your QTrobot according to your experimentâ€™s setup. Just by drag and drop, put different components together and build interactive applications to integrate QTrobot in your research.

## QTrobot ROS standard interfaces
The QTrobot ROS interface aims to facilitate accessing basic robot functionalities leveraging a set of user-friendly ROS interfaces. Each robot's functionality can be accessed in blocking and non-blocking mode using ROS publish/subscribe and Service/Client interfaces. For the time being, the following interfaces have been implemented:
- **Robot Emotion**  : implements robot facial emotion
- **Robot Speech**   : implements robot text to speech functionality
- **Robot Audio**    : implement a simple player to play standard audio files   
- **Robot Gesture**  : implements robot gesture control
- **Robot Behavior** : implements more complex behaviors by combining the robot basic functionality

Please visit [QTrobot Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/qtrobot) page for detailed information on how to use QTrobot in ROS.  

### Example: Accessing QT Robot interface from a python script
**[Non-blocking mode]** The following example shows how to access QT Robot *Speech* functionality using ROS publish/subscribe method from python:
```py
import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import String

# create a publisher
speechSay_pub = rospy.Publisher('/qt_robot/speech/say', String, queue_size=10)
...
# publish a text message to TTS (non-blocking)
speechSay_pub.publish("Hello! I am QT!")
```
**[blocking mode]** And the following example, re-implements the previous one using ROS Service/Client method from python:
```py
import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import String
from qt_robot_interface.srv import *

# create a service clients
speechSay = rospy.ServiceProxy('/qt_robot/speech/say', speech_say)
...
# call the service (blocking)
resp = speechSay("Hello! I am QT.")
```
