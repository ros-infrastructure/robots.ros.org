# Revel

Revel is an affordable 6 Degree of Freedom robotic manipulator from Svenzva Robotics. With a main appeal to      researchers, educators, and users of ROS in the field, Revel control is exposed through ROS interfaces. This     allows for greater experimentation and development using popular control packages like MoveIt! and ros_control,  in addition to embedded control solutions. Visit Revel's ROS [wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/Revel) page or    its [product page](https://svenzva.com/revel) for more information.
