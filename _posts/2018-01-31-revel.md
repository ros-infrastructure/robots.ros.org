# Revel

Revel is an affordable 6 Degree of Freedom robotic manipulator from Svenzva Robotics. 
Revel provides full state information at high baud (100Hz), has a 1.2kg payload at a full reach of 63cm.
Revel's opensource software was designed to allow integration into existing popular control interfaces in ROS, such as MoveIt! and ros_control, but can be controlled directly through embedded motor controllers.

Aside from power users, Revel can also be used as an educational platform or a lightweight addition to a mobile base. See Svenzva's [education outreach](http://svenzva.com/education/) page for more information on scholastic use cases.
