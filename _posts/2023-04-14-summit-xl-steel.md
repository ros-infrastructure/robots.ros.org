# Summit-XL-Steel

**Tough stainless design**
SUMMIT-XL STEEL is a robotic platform for application development (logistics, indoor transport, etc.). It has a robust design and can carry up to 250 kg payload.

The mobile platform has omnidirectional kinematics based on 4 high-power mechanum drive wheels. Each wheel integrates a brushless motor with a high precision odometer sensor.

The robot base can navigate autonomously or teleoperated by means of a PTZ camera that transmits video in real time.

SUMMIT-XL STEEL can be configured with a wide range of sensors. It also has internal (USB, RS232 and GPIO) and external connectivity (USB, RJ45, power supplies 5, 12 VDC and battery) to add custom components easily.

SUMMIT-XL STEEL uses the ROS open architecture.
