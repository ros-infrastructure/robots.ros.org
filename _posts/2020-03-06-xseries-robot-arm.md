"The new Interbotix X-Series Robot Arms are built around the high performance DYNAMIXEL X-Series smart servos from Robotis. The X-Series actuators offer higher torque, more efficient heat dissipation and better durability all at a smaller form factor over previous DYNAMIXEL servos.

 The XSeries arms offer many different configurations of length and payload with reach up to 750mm and working payload up to 750g. Additionally, they have between 4 and 6 degrees of freedom. Each of the arms comes assembled and tested out of the box.

 The arms (Pincher X 150 model or higher) come standard with an upgraded slewing bearing base, a wider customizable parallel gripper configuration and covered semi-transparent electronics shield that offers easy accessibility to ports while keeping the control board free from debris and safe from impact.

 All of the Interbotix X-Series arms are ROS compatible with packages / examples and demos available. For more information on ROS Packages see our Github: https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_arms"
