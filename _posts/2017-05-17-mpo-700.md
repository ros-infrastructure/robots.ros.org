## Neobotix Mobile Platform MPO-700 
The omnidirectional **MPO-700** is the ideal base for high-end service robots. Its four [Omni-Drive-Modules](http://www.neobotix-robots.com/components.html#c225) enable it to move extremely smoothly into any direction. This robot is even capable of rotating freely while driving to its destination.

* Fully omnidirectional manoeuvrability
* Very steady movements
* High stability and payload
* Compact, easily integrated drive units

This makes the **MPO-700** a high performance alternative for applications that require omnidirectional movements without the limitations of traditional kinematics.
