YZ-01 ROS robot platform is a two wheel differential and large load robot motion chassis platform based on ROS architecture. It is very suitable for the use of ROS robot enthusiasts, college students and small and medium enterprise R & D engineers.
     The chassis platform is an integrated hub motor with high efficiency and high load. The platform can load up to 50KG, and the maximum walking speed can reach 1 meters per second. YZ-01's built-in DCDC power conversion module can provide four different voltages of 5V, 12V, 19V and 24V, which can basically solve the power supply problems of the vast majority of computer motherboards and various sensors that the robot needs to carry.
     In order to facilitate developers to do in-depth research, the ROS platform has build-in Intel Core-i5 industrial PC and installed UBUNTU 16.04 O/S + ROS Kinetic packages. At the same time, like other ROS platform robots, ROS robot YZ-01A provides open source basic ROS application examples and basic motion driven node programs that allow developers to use it very easily.
