The BH8-series BarrettHand™ is a multi-fingered programmable grasper with the dexterity to secure target objects of different sizes, shapes, and orientations. 

Even with its low weight (980 grams) and super compact (25mm) base, it is totally self-contained. Communicating by industry-standard serial communications or high-speed CANbus (USB adapters included), integration with any arm is fast and simple.

The BH8-series immediately multiplies the value of any arm requiring flexible automation.
