The Farm-NG Amiga is an advanced agricultural management system designed to revolutionize farming practices and enhance productivity in the
agricultural industry. It combines cutting-edge technologies and data-driven insights to provide farmers and agricultural professionals with
comprehensive monitoring, control, and optimization capabilities for their farming operations.
 ## For Developers
 We love making tools, and built the Amiga robot to empower and inspire farmers, engineers, hackers, communities, or anyone with a vision to make it their own. The Amiga is a platform, community, and an ecosystem of components built to customize the Amiga, extend it, and maintain forever. In this section you will find our continually evolving robotics tool-set that makes building reliable outdoor systems easier and faster. We include products, code, documentation, CAD, links, and inspiration for your next project!
