# NED

Ned is a **collaborative** and **open source** **6-axis robot** made in France for:

- Higher education
- Vocational training
- R&D laboratories

Its use is particularly adapted to study robotics and programming in the context of the **industry 4.0**. Ned is the second manipulator robot developped by Niryo, after the Niryo One, bringing up improvments:

- The whole ROS architecture has been redesigned (see diagram below) in order to make Ned more **adaptative**
- Ned's mechanical structure relies on metal parts, that makes it more robust
- New EasyConnect system for easy tool changes
