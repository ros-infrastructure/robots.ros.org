The mobile platform RBCAR has RWD Ackerman kinematics. The traction is controlled by an AC motor with incremental encoder and the direction through a power steering system with absolute encoder.

Thanks to its mechanical structure and the rear drawer, this mobile platform can carry heavy loads. With the configuration of suitable sensors, the robot can navigate autonomously, teleoperated with a joystick or a steering wheel, as an electric vehicle.
