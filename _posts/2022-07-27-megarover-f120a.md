**Megarover F120A** is a differential drive mobile base robot developed by [[Vstone Co., Ltd.](https://www.vstone.co.jp/english/index.html)] for researchers. 

Megarover F120A inherits most of the features from its [predecessor](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/Megarover/MegaroverF120), such as:
- a large payload of 120 kg
- an aluminum housing for easy sensor-mounting and other customization
- Arduino IDE support for effortless software development
- ROS compatible

In addition, it is powered by brushless direct-drive in-wheel motors, which improves the noise reduction when operating.

## Features

**Brushless In-wheel motor** 
Megarover F120A uses brushless in-wheel motors, allowing it to reduce the operating noise up to 20db (compared to the previous model).

Megarover F120A can transport payload up to **120kg** 
with a max speed of **1.6m/s**.

**ROS Compatible**
Megarover F120A is able to communicate with ROS via rosserial. ROS packages with samples are also provided. 

**ESP32 main board**
With ESP32 built-in, that features Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, allowing Megarover F120A to be controlled wirelessly and programmed with the Arduino IDE.

**Easily Customizable**
It supports a wide variety of options, such as LRF, bumpers, wireless charging, ROS PC, depth camera, etc.
