### Description
The ready for series production version of the anthropomorphic SCHUNK 5-finger hand grips nearly as perfectly as the human hand. Due to the moving parts with a total of nine drives, various gripping operations can be executed with high sensitivity. Elastic gripping surfaces ensure a reliable grip on objects. The electronics are completely integrated in the wrist.

### Field of application
In addition to new dimensions in gripping and manipulation tasks, SCHUNK is defining the possibility of human / robot communication by gestures with the 5-finger hand.

### Advantages â€“ Your benefits
* Suited for mobile application fields by low energy consumption at 24 V DC
* Extremely compact design due to integration of the complete control, regulator and power electronics in wrist
* Defined interfaces for easy connection with market-standard industrial and lightweight robots
* ROS drivers for Kinetic
