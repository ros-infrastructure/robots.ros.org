### Description
The anthropomorphic SCHUNK 5-finger hand grips nearly as perfectly as the human hand. Due to the moving parts with a total of nine drives, various gripping operations can be executed with high sensitivity. Elastic gripping surfaces ensure a reliable grip on objects. The electronics are completely integrated in the wrist.

### Field of application
In addition to new dimensions in gripping and manipulation tasks, SCHUNK is defining the possibility of human / robot communication by gestures with the 5-finger hand.

### Advantages â€“ Your benefits
* Suited for mobile application fields by low energy consumption at 24 V DC
* Extremely compact design due to integration of the complete control, regulator and power electronics in wrist
* Defined interfaces for easy connection with market-standard industrial and lightweight robots
* ROS drivers for Kinetic

The ready for series production version of the anthropomorphic SCHUNK 5-finger hand grips nearly as perfectly as the human hand. Due to the moving parts with a total of nine drives, various gripping operations can be executed with high sensitivity. Elastic gripping surfaces ensure a reliable grip on objects. The electronics are completely integrated in the wrist.

The anthropomorphic SCHUNK 5-Finger-Hand is used together with the lightweight robotic arm LWA 4P to simulate human motions. The size, weight, and flexibility of the 5-Finger-Hand are very similar to a real human hand and can be used for dexterous manipulation and gestures. A new developed ROS driver for the hand controls all nine active joints and is used together with the ROS motion driver of the 6-DOF arm. An intuitive teach-in interface with the ability to add, edit and save new key pose makes it easy to create new trajectories for a desired task. The trajectories between these key points are interpolated automatically. The hand and arm trajectories are synchronized and create smooth combined motions as shown in the video.
