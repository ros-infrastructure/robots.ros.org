# **MIP robotics : Making Industrial Robotics Accessible To All**

**Junior 300** is an industrial collaborative robot created by MIP robotics.
It is **robust**, **easy to program**, **collaborative**, **safe**, and **provides fast ROI**.
We provide here a sample code, showing compatibility with **MoveIt!** and **Gazebo**.

## **Keypoints**


### **Robust**

**MIP Junior** is currently running **24h/6d** in **Toshiba**'s production line.
 The robot has been running for **over a million cycles** during which the system was capable of reaching a **success ratio of 99.5%**.

### **Easy to program**

The Junior can be **easily instructed** directly on the **tablet** for simple programs. For more complex program we have developed a **highly intuitive drag and drop** programming solution allowing counters, conditions, loops, screwing, liquid deposition, and many new application in the pipe works...

### **Provides fast ROI**

The **simplicity of programming**, **low price** (below 10,000€) and **universal interface** makes the integration of our robot **faster and simpler**. Therefore decreasing the overall cost of your solution and increasing your ROI.

### **Operator helper**

The MIP Junior is a **collaborative robot**. It is designed to reduce operator fatigue and repetitive stress injuries.
