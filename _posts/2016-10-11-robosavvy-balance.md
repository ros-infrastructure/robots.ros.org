# RoboSavvy Self-balancing robotic platform

A robust, reliable and flexible self-balancing mobile platform for robotic applications.

This platform provides researchers, engineers and hackers the ability to easily design their robotic application on top of a modular hardware interface. The user can quickly develop and integrate their own hardware, integrate sensors, manipulators, other types of payload and third party equipment on top of the platform.

### Features

 * Self-balancing mobile platform for loads from 10 kg up to 100 kg.
 * Integrated PC running Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo.
 * Urban dweller and countryside explorer.
 * Dual control:
  1. 9 channel RC input
  2. UART protocol over USB CDC device
 * ROS packages for communication, visualization and simulation.
