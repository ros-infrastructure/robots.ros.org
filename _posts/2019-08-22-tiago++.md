TIAGo++ is a service robot designed to work in indoor environments. TIAGo++ features make it the ideal platform for research, especially on ambient assisted living or light industry where ambidextrous tasks are required. It combines mobility, perception, manipulation and human-robot interaction capabilities for one specific goal: to be able to assist in research.

Now customers have the option of choosing an omnidirectional drive wheelbase, for 360 degrees of movement, for TIAGo ++ to adapt to  their research needs.
