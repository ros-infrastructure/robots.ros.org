# Aubo Robotics I-Series

Aubo robotics I-Series are high-quality and low-cost industrial robots with a fully modulized design.
The robotics can be configured 4 to 7 degrees of freedom to meet specific requirements.
I-series robots adopt open source software architecture, which is convenient for users and developers to inregrate existing software and algorithms.
Compared with the industral robots with similar features and payloads, I-series robots are compact, light weight, high accuray, and easy to instal and program.

* Modulized design
    * User can configure 4-7 degrees of freedom to meet specific requirements.

* Light weight
    * Manipulator is less than 20kg,the ratio of maximun payload and weight is 1:4.

* Openness
    * Provides a ROS API

* Safety
    * Collision detection function. emergency brake distance is less than 1mm.

* Easy operation
    * Provides a graphic user interface to enable online programming and simulation.

* Intelligence
    * Based on a cloud platform with remote maintenance, fault diagnosis, and online upgrading.
