introduction: The LoCoBot is a mobile manipulator from Carnegie Mellon University and designed to run Facebook AI's PyRobot. PyRobot is an open source, lightweight, high-level interface on top of the robot operating system (ROS). It provides a consistent set of hardware-independent mid-level APIs to control different robots. PyRobot abstracts away details about low-level controllers and interprocess communication so users can focus on building high-level AI robotics applications.

The LoCoBot is a mobile manipulator from Carnegie Mellon University and designed to run Facebook AI's PyRobot. PyRobot is an open source, lightweight, high-level interface on top of the robot operating system (ROS). It provides a consistent set of hardware-independent mid-level APIs to control different robots. PyRobot abstracts away details about low-level controllers and interprocess communication so users can focus on building high-level AI robotics applications.

The LoCoBot is built on the Yujin Robot Kobuki Base (YMR-K01-W1) and powered by the Intel NUC NUC7i5BNH Mini PC. The platform also comes with the WidowX 200 Mobile Manipulator and an Intel® [RealSense](wiki.ros.org/RealSense)™ Depth Camera D435. LoCoBot comes partially assembled and is designed for users to be up and running as soon as possible.
