**Autonomous and collaborative mobile platform**
The RB-1 BASE mobile robot is designed for the development of indoor logistics applications. The platform can carry different payloads and materials or integrate other systems such as a robotic arm or torso.

RB-1 BASE can incorporate a wide range of localisation and navigation lasers with operating distances from 5 to 30-60 meters and RGBD sensors for obstacle detection. The standard configuration integrates the UST-20LX sensor and the Orbbec Astra sensor. This allows the robot to stop, avoid obstacles or find an alternative route if necessary to reach the next waypoint. 

The robot software consists of a control system, a localisation system (laser-based) and a navigation system as well as a (basic) HMI user interface.

All Robotnik robots are fully customisable and based on ROS.
