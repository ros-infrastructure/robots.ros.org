ROSbot 2.0 PRO is an autonomous, open source robot platform running on Husarion CORE2-ROS controller. It can be used as a learning platform for Robot Operating System as well as a base for a inspection robots, custom service robots etc.

It integrates:

 - [CORE2-ROS](https://husarion.com/manuals/core2/) controller (with UP board which contains Intel Atom and 4GB of RAM)
 - 4-wheels mobile platform containing 4 DC motors with encoders
 - Orbbec Astra RGBD camera
 - RPLIDAR A3 laser scanner
 - MPU 9250 inertial sensor (accelerometer + gyro)
 - VL53L0X time-of-flight distance sensor
 - 3 x 3500 mAh Li-Ion batteries with protection circuits
 - rear panel providing controls and interfaces for additional modules
 - high profile alloy wheels
 - robust, black-painted aluminum chassis

The new ROSbot 2.0 PRO is an advanced version of ROSbot 2.0. The main differences are:
 - much more powerful SBC (UP board RE-UP-CHT01-A12-0432)
 - aluminum wheels
 - higher LiDAR range (RPLIDAR A3)

The rear panel allows to connect additional devices (eg. sensors or servos). USB and HDMI ports are useful for the software development.
