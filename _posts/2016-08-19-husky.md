# Husky UGV

Husky is a medium sized robotic development platform. Its large payload capacity and power systems accommodate an extensive variety of payloads, customized to meet research needs. Stereo cameras, LIDAR, GPS, IMUs, manipulators and more can be added to the UGV by our integration experts. The Husky’s rugged construction and high-torque drivetrain can take your research where no other robot can go. Husky is fully supported in ROS with community driven Open Source code and examples—all of the packages are available in the [Husky github org](https://github.com/husky).
