**Collaborative mobile manipulator for industrial applications**
RB-KAIROS+ is a mobile manipulator designed for the plug&play integration of Universal Robots e-Series arms. Its software and hardware are fully prepared to mount the arm OEM DC e-series and thus turn the robotic arm into a mobile manipulator. This allows unlimited expansion of the cobot workspace that can operate on large parts or perform pick&place operations in large areas. In this sense, it enables a wide range of new applications and it is a great complement for current URe arm users.

RB-KAIROS+ is extremely useful for industrial applications such as pick and place, part feeding, metrology, quality control, operations on large parts or packaging, cleaning, polishing, screwing, drilling, etc. Without a doubt, it is an excellent way to improve the productivity of any factory.

In addition, RB-KAIROS+ has been designed to be a collaborative mobile manipulator able to work in industrial environments. Thanks to its safety laser scanners (optional), the robot can safely share the workspace with the operators.

RB-KAIROS+ has a robust steel design and can carry up to 250 Kg. The mobile platform has omnidirectional kinematics based on 4 high-power drive wheels.

RB-KAIROS+ can navigate autonomously and can be configured with a wide range of sensors and components found within the UR+ ecosystem.

RB-KAIROS+ is a UR+ certified product.
