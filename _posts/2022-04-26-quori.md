[Quori](https://www.quori.org) is novel, affordable, and modular social robot designed for human-robot interaction researchers. The design of Quori is motivated by feedback from the HRI research community.

A complete description of Quori's design, hardware, and software can be found in the journal paper *Quori: A Community-Informed Design of a Socially Interactive Humanoid Robot* (DOI: 10.1109/TRO.2021.3111718).

Ten Quori platforms have been awarded to researchers across the United States to facilitate HRI research and build a community database from a common platform.
