Romeo is a humanoid robot built by [Aldebaran](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en). 
The ROS Romeo description was originally developed by LAAS [laas/romeo stack](https://github.com/laas/romeo). 
Since the robot uses Aldebaran's NaoQI framework, we can use [naoqi_driver](http://wiki.ros.org/naoqi_driver)
ROS driver that is common for Nao, Pepper, and Romeo. 
It wraps the needed parts of NaoQI API and makes it available in ROS.
