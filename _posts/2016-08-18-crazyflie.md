Crazyflie is an open-source and open-hardware nano quadcopter made by Bitcraze. There are several models available:
- [Crazyflie 2.X](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/) is a small quadrotor (9cm motor-to-motor, 27g). 
- [Crazyflie Bolt](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-bolt/) is a flight controller for quadrotors that can be used for custom drones.

Both models have an extension port to allow to add hardware add-ons (so-called decks). Depending on the equipped decks, the Crazyflie platform can reach different levels of autonomy.

All models are supported by ROS and can be controlled from a host computer using a special USB dongle called [Crazyradio PA.](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyradio-pa/)

## ROS Packages
[Crazyswarm](https://github.com/USC-ACTLab/crazyswarm) workspace containing driver, simulation, and demo applications.

Note that this is the official successor of [crazyflie ros package](http://wiki.ros.org/crazyflie) for ROS Melodic, ROS Noetic, and beyond.
