TIAGo OMNI Base is PAL Robotics’ recently developed omnidrive robot. TIAGo OMNI Base is complete with omnidirectional drive with 3 DoF mecanum wheels and includes two LIDAR sensors for an unobstructed 360º FOV secure movement. This includes autonomous navigation and obstacle detection. TIAGo OMNI Base is part of the TIAGo robot family, which includes the original Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) with differential drive, TIAGo Base.

TIAGo OMNI Base users can take full advantage of the manoeuvrability offered by TIAGo OMNI Base’s omnidrive base for path planning. The omnidirectional robot base provides precision positioning even in constrained environments. This is where a robot with omnidirectional movement appears to be the most optimal proposal thanks to its versatility of 360º movement.

In summary, TIAGo OMNI Base offers the following advantages:

- EFFICIENT: Autonomous navigation, detection of obstacles and route planning.
- HIGHLY MANOEUVRABLE: Four omnidirectional mechanical wheels to navigate in all directions.
- CUSTOMIZABLE: You can customize it with accessories to fit your needs.
- HIGH TRACTION: Optimum navigation results in uneven surfaces.
