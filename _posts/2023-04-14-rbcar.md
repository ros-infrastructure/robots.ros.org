**Platform for research and transport**
The mobile robot RB-CAR has RWD Ackermann kinematics. The traction is controlled by an AC motor with incremental encoder and the direction through a power steering system with absolute encoder.

Thanks to its mechanical structure and the rear drawer, this mobile platform can carry heavy loads. With the configuration of suitable sensors, the robot can be programmed to navigate autonomously or teleoperated with a joystick or a steering wheel.

It has front and rear drum brakes that allow the robot to stop immediately, by a local or an optional remote emergency button. The robot can mount any standard accessory from the company (Hokuyo laser, Sick laser, 3D lidar, DGPS kits, etc.) and any sensor required by the customer. It also has internal connectivity (USB) and external (USB, RJ45, DC/DC voltage) by demand to quickly connect the components.
