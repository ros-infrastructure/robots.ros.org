## Powerball Lightweight Arm LWA 4P

### The lightweight arm with the world's best compact performance

The most compact, powerful lightweight arm in the world with three highly-integrated Powerball modules offers 6 degrees of freedom. Integrated intelligence makes powerful, mobile handling possible as never before.

The lightweight arm with the world's most compact performance with three highly-integrated Powerball modules offers 6 degrees of freedom. Integrated intelligence makes power­ful, mobile handling possible as never before. The battery operation makes the LWA 4P mains-independent. Combining it with the SDH 3-finger hand from SCHUNK not only increases the number of degrees of freedom by another 7, but also permits typical tasks to be accomplished flexibly in the area of service robotics ? seamlessly integrated, without external cabling.

### Your advantages

* Mobile, mains-independent use with optional battery operation possible.
* A low capacity of 12 Ah allows an 8-hour operation without charging.
* Low energy consumption at 24 Volt DC
* High torque, speed and repeat accuracy for rapid acceleration, short cycle times and high process stability
* Complete integration of control, regulator and power electronics does not require a control cabinet
* Compact quick-change system for quick and easy
* grippers and tools assembly
* Internal cabling with free wires
* Expandable without disruptive cables
* High compact performance and extremely compact
* Lightweight construction and new design provide a weight/load capacity ratio of 2:1
