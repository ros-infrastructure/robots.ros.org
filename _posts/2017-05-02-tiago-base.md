TIAGo Base is an indoor mobile robot designed with minimum footprint and maximum
payload in mind. Its primary sensors are a laser range finder, an IMU and ultrasound sensors even though additional sensors and devices can be easily integrated in the user panel. TIAGo Base features
built-in speakers so the robot can inform its surroundings of the completion of
a task or ask you to rescue it from under a pile of objects. It also has
already developed software for navigation. This robot runs on ROS Kinetic
internally, and uses state-of-the-art ros_control components.

Now TIAGo Base also comes with an omnidirectional drive wheelbase, for 360 degrees of movement, offering flexibility in intralogistics.
