# Nav2

The Nav2 is a modular robotics platform created by Crosswing Inc, consisting of an omniwheel holonomic mobile base and interchangeable upper components.
The Nav2's base configuration is that of a telepresence robot, the VirtualMe.
To operate the mobile base, you must connect your control computer to the Nav2's control board, located in the lower compartment.
The board can be networked with using a variety of configurations such as static IP, or DHCP with zeroconf DNS (e.g. avahi).
Once connected, you can start the appropriate launch file in the `nav2_platform` stack to begin controlling the base.
