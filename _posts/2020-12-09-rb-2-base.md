RB-2 Base is a mobile robot designed for industrial applications such as the transport of materials in factories or warehouses. It is a completely autonomous and collaborative robot, so it can work safely in the environment where people work.

The platform uses a differential kinematic configuration with omni-wheel castors that distributes the payload in the corners, providing the maximal stability in the minimal footprint. The robot mounts two 1000W servo motors that provide it with a linear speed up to 1.7 m/s. It mounts two laser range finders for localization, navigation and safety as also RGBD devices for the detection of obstacles out of the rangefinder plane.

The robot includes an optional self-recharging base station and lifting unit.
