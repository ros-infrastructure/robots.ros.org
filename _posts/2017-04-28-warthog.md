# Warthog UGV

Warthog is a large all-terrain unmanned ground vehicle capable of traveling on land and in water.
It can handle tough environments with its rugged build, low ground pressure, and traction tires, which allow effortless mobility through soft soils, vegetation, thick muds, and steep grades.
Payload mounting plates and accessible power and communication ports allow Warthog to be easily customized with sensors, manipulators and other payloads to accommodate a wide variety of robotics applications in mining, agriculture and environmental monitoring.

Warthogâ€™s onboard PC comes with the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS) preinstalled and configured.
