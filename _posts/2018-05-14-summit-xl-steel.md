# Summit-XL-Steel

SUMMIT-XL STEEL is a robotic platform for application development (logistics, indoor transport, etc.) manufactured by [Robotnik](http://www.robotnik.eu/). Its excellent mechanical steel structure allows carrying heavy loads up to 130 Kg. 

The robot base can navigate autonomously or teleoperated by means of a PTZ camera that transmits video in real time.

## Characteristics

* Dimensions: 843 x 524 x 415 mm
* Weight: 90 Kg
* Load capacity: 130 Kg
* Speed: 3 m/s
* Accessories:
    * 2x Laser (e.g. Hokuyo, Sick family) providing 360 degrees of coverage
    * Inertial Measurement System nIMU
    * 2x Cameras PTZ (front and rear)
    * GPS
    * Camera range 3D (ORBBEC)

## Releated Repositories

The following metapackages provide all the necessary ROSpackages for simulating in Gazebo and Rviz.


* [summit_xl_sim](http://wiki.ros.org/summit_xl_sim) : Packages for the simulation of the SUMMIT XL and SUMMIT XL STEEL.
* [summit_xl_common](http://wiki.ros.org/summit_xl_common) : Common packages of the SUMMIT XL: URDF description of the SUMMIT XL, SUMMIT XL HL, SUMMIT XL STEEL, platform messages and other files for simulation.
