# Otto Bock SensorHand Speed
SensorHand Speed is a hand prosthetics product developed by Otto Bock.
The device essentially consists of a force and velocity controlled gripper that is controlled by integrated electronics.
In normal operation mode, electrodes that are attached to the user's arm are connected to the hand's interface and provide analog signals that allow gripping operations.
The hand can also be switched to communications mode which allows accessing the device via an RS-232 interface (19200-8-N-1).
It is also possible to set the device to a mode in which internal data (measured forces, voltages and currents) is sent over the serial interface every 12 ms.
