The Tinymovr M series, an even more compact variant, is suitable for FOC control of "gimbal" style motors. It has an input voltage range of 12-38V and max continuous phase current of 5A. 

Tinymovr integrates an absolute angle encoder (MPS MA702) for instant system start-up and precise position tracking, and can interface with external sensors such as Hall effect or SPI sensors.

Tinymovr utilizes CAN bus for communication, ensuring robust and reliable operation. It is equipped with various safety features including overcurrent, over- and under-voltage, and overtemperature protection, ensuring reliable operation in demanding environments. The compact size and high performance of both Tinymovr R5 and M5 make it an ideal choice for developers looking to build compact and efficient robotic systems.

Here is a short presentation video of Tinymovr R5:

We offer integrations in Python, Arduino, C++ and ROS. The ROS package includes a simple example of a differential drive robot that should get you up and running in no time.

Tinymovr can be integrated with a wide range of brushless motors and motor-reducer units. We offer integration of custom motors, including design and manufacture of custom brackets and motor/controller calibration. Please get in touch at info@tinymovr.com for more information.
