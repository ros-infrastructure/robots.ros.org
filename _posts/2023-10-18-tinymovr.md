Tinymovr M series, an even more compact variant, is suitable for FOC control of "gimbal" style motors. It has an input voltage range of 12-38V and max continuous phase current of 5A. 

Tinymovr integrates an absolute angle encoder (MPS MA702) for instant system start-up and precise position tracking, and can interface with external sensors such as Hall effect or SPI sensors.

Tinymovr utilizes CAN bus for communication, ensuring robust and reliable operation. It is equipped with various safety features including overcurrent, over- and under-voltage, and overtemperature protection, ensuring reliable operation in demanding environments. The compact size and high performance of both Tinymovr R5 and M5 make it an ideal choice for developers looking to build compact and efficient robotic systems.

Here is a short presentation video of Tinymovr R5:

We offer integrations in Python, Arduino, C++ and ROS. The ROS package includes a simple example of a differential drive robot that should get you up and running in no time.

Tinymovr can be integrated with any brushless motor of your choice within specs. We also offer custom integration  we will assemble and calibrate the setup to make sure it will work flawlessly.
