# Goals

This site is designed to provide a showcase for robots using ROS.

## Who can contribute?

Anyone can contribute to the site. However it is expected that the majority of contributors are expecected to be the robot manufacturers or ROS integratoin maintainers.

## What content should be on the site?

This site is designed to be a portal for discovery and comparison of robots that publicly documented ROS interfaces.

Developer documentation should remain on the [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org).
And pages on this site should not be the primary reference for a robot.
It should have it's own website with the majority of it's marketing and promotional content sales opportunities etc.

## Featured Spotlight

Robots may be promoted to the spotlight on the home page.
To inquire about being promoted please contact  info@osrfoundation.org .

## How to contribute

Please [open a pull request on github](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/robots.ros.org) to add a robot or make an update to the site.

Documentation on how the site is setup can be found below.

## Guidelines for contributions

- Make sure to follow the tagging conventions.
- Do not spam the site with small variants of robot names. Only have one entry per major version, a model upgrade should not generate a new page.
- Keep the look and feel of the overall site, but feel free to customize within the framework.
- External javascript dependencies are generally discouraged but can be considered.
