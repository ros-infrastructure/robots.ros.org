# Overview

This is a site to show off ROS robots. Please contribute your ROS supported robots.

## History
This site replaces wiki.ros.org/Robots as the best place to find out about ROS robots.

One of the main reasons for the switch is that the Robots page is causing a significant load on the wiki, and with the switch we can give a richer more responsive experience.

## Submissions

This is intended to be a community sourced website with contributions from developers who are making robots available.

Initially we will likely source material from the ROS wiki, but hope that people will continue to contribute here as they do on the wiki.

Please see the **contributing.md** for more info on how to contribute.
